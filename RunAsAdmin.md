## Simple Batch file to bypass UAC Admin for installing programs in Windows. 

### Version 1

```bash
Set __COMPAT_LAYER=RUNASINVOKER
Start demo.exe ; Name of the PE that you want to install
```

### Version 2

```bash
cmd /min /C "set __COMPAT_LAYER=RUNASINVOKER && start "" %1"
```


Here are several enhancements you can consider to make the script more robust and effective:

1. **Parameter Validation:**  
   Check if the argument is provided and if the target file exists. This prevents the script from silently failing or launching an unintended command when no or an incorrect parameter is passed.

2. **Proper Quoting:**  
   Use proper quoting (e.g., `%~1`) to handle paths with spaces. This ensures that the entire path is interpreted as a single argument.

3. **Error Handling:**  
   Add error checking after commands to log or display useful error messages if something goes wrong. This might involve checking error levels (`%ERRORLEVEL%`) after attempting to start the process.

4. **Logging:**  
   Consider logging the activity to a file. This can be useful for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.

5. **Support for Additional Arguments:**  
   If your executable requires additional parameters, consider passing `%*` (all arguments) rather than just `%1`. This increases the flexibility of your script.

6. **User Feedback:**  
   Provide clear feedback messages to the user if the command fails, such as "File not found" or "Insufficient arguments provided."

Below is an example of an improved version of the script:

```batch
@echo off
REM Check if an argument was provided
if "%~1"=="" (
    echo Error: No target executable specified.
    goto :eof
)

REM Check if the file exists
if not exist "%~1" (
    echo Error: The file "%~1" does not exist.
    goto :eof
)

REM Set the compatibility layer to bypass elevation prompts
set __COMPAT_LAYER=RUNASINVOKER

REM Launch the executable with all provided arguments
start "" "%~1" %*
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Error: Failed to launch "%~1".
) else (
    echo Successfully launched "%~1".
)
```

### Explanation of Enhancements

- **Parameter Validation:**  
  The script now checks if `%~1` is empty and if the specified file exists before proceeding.

- **Proper Quoting:**  
  `%~1` removes any surrounding quotes that might interfere with path processing, and the path is re-quoted to preserve spaces.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**  
  After attempting to launch the executable with `start`, the script checks the error level to provide a message indicating success or failure.

- **Support for Additional Arguments:**  
  Using `%*` passes any additional arguments supplied to the batch file along with the target executable.

Implementing these improvements makes the script safer, more reliable, and user-friendly while retaining the core functionality of running an executable under the `RUNASINVOKER` compatibility layer.
